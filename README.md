# Sound Mania
Sound Mania is a dead-simple Web App that lets you play and mix various kinds of your familiar sounds. There are short sound clips of different animals and natural elements for you to play with. 😍
## Getting Started
You know what to do! You can download the project files from the repository itself as zip file. You can also clone the project to your local storage if you like. Just run the command below in your Git CLI and you'll be good to go. 😁

```bash
git clone https://github.com/siamekanto19/SoundMania.git
```
## About the Project
I'm an absolute Newbie in the Web Development Game. Sound Mania is my first ever JavaScript Project that I think deserves to be a GitHub Repository. This is a dead-simple Web App made with JavaScript that lets you play and mix various kinds of small sound clips collected from the Internet. There are currently 20 different sound clips of animals and nature and many more things. However, I'll try to add more sound clips to the website soon. 🤞

I have seen a lot of other websites that do the same thing and even better than this. But I think I haven't found any of those website's User Interface to be attracting. That's why I have chosen this Project to start my journey. I've made the website as minimal as it could possibly get. Feel free to contribute to the project by adding more sounds or more features if you like. ❤

The sounds in this project has been collected from http://soundbible.com and the icons has been collected from https://flaticon.com (They are awesome!)

The Website is also currently live on Netlify. You can check that out here- https://soundmania.netlify.app 👈

## Contribution
I believe every other Web Developer on GitHub is more skilled than I am. Come on, I'm new here! I will be more than happy if anyone decides to contribute to this project. To add new sounds, Pull Requests are always welcome. For major changes or modification, I will be pleased if you open an issue beforehand to let me know what you are willing to change. Cheers! 🙌
