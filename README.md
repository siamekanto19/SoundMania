# Sound Mania
Sound Mania is a dead-simple Web App that lets you play and mix various kinds of your familiar sounds in a Beautiful and Minimal Interface.
## About the Project
I'm an absolute Newbie in the Web Development Game. Sound Mania is my first ever JavaScript Project that I think deserves to be a GitHub Repository. This is a dead-simple Web App made with JavaScript that lets you play and mix various kinds of small sound clips collected from the Internet. There are currently 20 different sound clips of animals and nature and many more things. However, I'll constantly be adding more sound clips to the website.<br><br>I have seen a lot of other websites that do the same thing and even better than this. But I think I haven't found any of those website's User Interface to be attracting. That's why I have chosen this Project to start my journey. I've made the website as minimal as it could possibly get. Feel free to contribute to the project by adding more sounds or more features if you like. ‚ù§
## Contribution
I believe every other Web Developer on GitHub is more skilled than I am. Come on, I'm new here! I will be more than happy if anyone decides to contribute to this project. To add new sounds, Pull Requests are always welcome. For major changes or modification, I will be pleased if you open an issue beforehand to let me know what you are willing to change. Cheers! üôå
